00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 This morning I wake up and I look in the mirror

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Every part of my body was in the place many people lie

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 I don't wanna act too high and mighty cause tomorrow I may fall down on my face

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Lord I thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain, thank you for joy, thank you for pain

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
